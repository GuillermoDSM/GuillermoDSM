# Hi, I'm Guillermo

I love writing code that turns ideas into reality. If your project challenges the norm and dares to be different, keep reading.

- **My daily toolkit:** Next.js, C++, Supabase, PostgreSQL, TS, TailwindCSS, Solidity, XRPL, etc.
- **Passion for Finance, Blockchain, and Art:** Forever chasing the next breakthrough.
- **Collaborative spirit:** I find myself drawn to projects that quietly defy expectations.

Got something interesting? Let's talk.
