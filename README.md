## Hi, I'm Guillermo

I love writing code that turns ideas into reality. If your project challenges the norm and dares to be different, keep reading.

- **My daily toolkit:** Next.js, C++, Supabase, Posgres SQL, TS, TailwindCSS, Solidity, XRPL, etc.
- **Passion for Finance, Blockchain, Art:** Always on the lookout for that next breakthrough.
- **Collaborative spirit:** I tend to partner only on projects that surprise and inspire.
